### What I learned
This project was the most difficult by far. The one lesson that was way more important than the rest was knowing how to manage click events for dynamically created elements. I am also grateful I now know how to edit, store data with Local Storage, import libraries with node packet manager, and manage javascript objects better. This project also took a long time; I had to learn how to work on projects long term. The code is not the cleanest and not the most reusable, these are things I have to work on in the future.

## Build for production

npm run build
```
